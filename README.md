# Deep Learning-Based Cataract Detection System

## Description
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for automated cataract detection in eye images. The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms An CNN models to accurately identify the presence and severity of cataracts, enabling early diagnosis and treatment.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GeekyYouthsInfo/Deep-Learning-Cataract-Detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow additional setup instructions in the `README.md` file.

## Usage
1. Run the main script locally: `python detect_cataracts.py`
2. Follow on-screen instructions to upload eye images and view the detection results.
3. For detailed usage guidelines, refer to the [documentation](
https://deep-learning-cataract-detection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Model Deployment (Cloud)
1. The trained model is deployed on a cloud platform for scalability and accessibility.
2. Access the deployed model through the provided API endpoint or web interface.
3. Submit HTTP requests with eye images to the endpoint for cataract detection.
4. Receive the detection results as JSON or through the web interface.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
